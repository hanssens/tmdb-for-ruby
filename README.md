TheMovieDb API in Ruby
=============

Undoubtly yet another TheMovieDb.org (TMDB) API wrapper, in Ruby.

Exercising a first attempt into doing something with Ruby, in this case communicating with [TheMovieDb API](http://themoviedb.org). Of course, I'm fully aware there are lots of projects covering the TMDB API in Ruby. But I deliberately haven't looked into any of them, just to this a go and see where it lands ;)
